= GitHub Activity Reports

Python scripts that generate activity reports from GitHub repositories for specified time periods.

== Scripts

=== github_monthly_report.py

Fetches and summarizes closed pull requests and issues from configured GitHub repositories using the GitHub CLI (`gh`). It provides a comprehensive monthly report showing all closed PRs and issues with their details.

=== github_weekly_report.py

Fetches pull requests and issues authored by you that were created or closed during a specified week. Shows your personal activity across all repositories where you're a contributor.

== Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher
* GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated

=== Installing GitHub CLI

Visit https://cli.github.com/ for installation instructions.

After installation, authenticate with:

[source,bash]
----
gh auth login
----

== Configuration

Before running the script, edit `github_monthly_report.py` and configure the `REPOSITORIES` list with the repositories you want to track:

[source,python]
----
REPOSITORIES = [
    "owner/repo1",
    "owner/repo2",
    # Add more repositories as needed
]
----

== Usage

=== Monthly Report

Run the script with a month in `YYYY-MM` format:

[source,bash]
----
./github_monthly_report.py 2026-01
----

Or using Python directly:

[source,bash]
----
python3 github_monthly_report.py 2026-01
----

==== Example

To generate a report for January 2026:

[source,bash]
----
./github_monthly_report.py 2026-01
----

=== Weekly Report

Run without arguments to get last week's activity (Monday-Sunday):

[source,bash]
----
./github_weekly_report.py
----

Or specify a week using any date within that week:

[source,bash]
----
./github_weekly_report.py --week 2026-01-20
----

Or using Python directly:

[source,bash]
----
python3 github_weekly_report.py --week 2026-01-20
----

==== Example

To generate a report for last week:

[source,bash]
----
./github_weekly_report.py
----

To generate a report for a specific week (e.g., the week containing January 20, 2026):

[source,bash]
----
./github_weekly_report.py --week 2026-01-20
----

== Troubleshooting

=== GitHub CLI not authenticated

If you see an authentication error, run:

[source,bash]
----
gh auth status
----

If not authenticated, run:

[source,bash]
----
gh auth login
----

=== No repositories configured

Edit the script and add repositories to the `REPOSITORIES` list at the top of the file.

=== Invalid month format

Ensure you use the `YYYY-MM` format (e.g., `2026-01` for January 2026).
