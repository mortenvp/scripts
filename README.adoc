= GitHub Monthly Report

A Python script that generates activity reports from GitHub repositories for a specified month.

== Description

This script fetches and summarizes closed pull requests and issues from configured GitHub repositories using the GitHub CLI (`gh`). It provides a comprehensive monthly report showing all closed PRs and issues with their details.

== Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher
* GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated

=== Installing GitHub CLI

Visit https://cli.github.com/ for installation instructions.

After installation, authenticate with:

[source,bash]
----
gh auth login
----

== Configuration

Before running the script, edit `github_monthly_report.py` and configure the `REPOSITORIES` list with the repositories you want to track:

[source,python]
----
REPOSITORIES = [
    "owner/repo1",
    "owner/repo2",
    # Add more repositories as needed
]
----

== Usage

Run the script with a month in `YYYY-MM` format:

[source,bash]
----
./github_monthly_report.py 2026-01
----

Or using Python directly:

[source,bash]
----
python3 github_monthly_report.py 2026-01
----

=== Example

To generate a report for January 2026:

[source,bash]
----
./github_monthly_report.py 2026-01
----

== Output

The script generates a detailed report containing:

* Summary statistics (total PRs, issues, and repositories)
* Per-repository breakdown showing:
** Closed pull requests with merge status
** Closed issues
** Links to each PR/issue
** Closure dates

== Features

* Fetches up to 1000 PRs and issues per repository
* Filters results by closure date within the specified month
* Distinguishes between merged and closed (unmerged) pull requests
* Provides clickable links to each PR and issue
* Shows formatted dates for easy reading

== Troubleshooting

=== GitHub CLI not authenticated

If you see an authentication error, run:

[source,bash]
----
gh auth status
----

If not authenticated, run:

[source,bash]
----
gh auth login
----

=== No repositories configured

Edit the script and add repositories to the `REPOSITORIES` list at the top of the file.

=== Invalid month format

Ensure you use the `YYYY-MM` format (e.g., `2026-01` for January 2026).
